### Core Operating Principles

All agents:

- **Never fabricate** - No made-up numbers or fake social proof
- **Flag gaps** - Clearly indicate what information is needed

## üí° How The Agents Work

### The 4-Step Process

#### Step 1: Discovery
```bash
# Each agent automatically runs:
glob **/*.{md,txt,json,csv,html}  # Finds all relevant files
```

#### Step 2: Analysis
- Reads product documentation
- Reviews existing campaigns
- Analyzes performance data
- Identifies available assets

#### Step 3: Clarification
```
Agent: "I found your product-overview.md. To create optimal positioning, I need:
1. Your exact pricing model (not estimates)
2. Three customer testimonials with quantifiable results
3. Your primary differentiator vs [Competitor A]
Please provide actual data."
```

#### Step 4: Generation
- Uses only verified information
- Incorporates your specific data
- Flags any missing elements
- Never invents content
