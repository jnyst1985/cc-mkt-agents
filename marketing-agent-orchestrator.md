### Sequential Processing
When outputs build on each other:
```
Input: "Create complete campaign for new SaaS product"

Step 1: Use product-marketing-strategist
→ Analyzes market and competitors
→ Asks for pricing, testimonials, differentiators
→ Save output as: positioning-[product].md

Step 2: Use landing-page-optimizer
→ Reads positioning-[product].md
→ Asks for logos, case studies, conversion goals
→ Save output as: landing-page-[product].md

Step 3: Use conversion-copywriter
→ References both previous files
→ Asks for compliance, channels, objections
→ Save output as: email-sequence-[product].md
```

### Parallel Processing
After positioning is complete, simultaneously run:
- landing-page-optimizer → Landing pages
- conversion-copywriter → Email sequences
- ux-microcopy-specialist → Interface copy

All will reference the same positioning doc for consistency.
